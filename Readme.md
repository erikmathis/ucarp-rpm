This repository provides a script for building a ucarp RPM for RHEL, or
derivative, systems. This RPM is different from the EPEL package in that it
is built against the [pidfile branch][pbranch] of the upstream source.

Other than that, the RPM specific resources have been borrowed from the
EPEL source -- http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ucarp.git/
